        description={`Pursuit is an innovative startup aiming to revolutionize golf training by integrating Electroencephalography (EEG) technology. 
          The goal is to provide golf coaches and players with a cutting-edge tool to monitor and enhance mental focus and relaxation during training sessions. 
          By leveraging EEG data, the system helps players optimize their mental state, ultimately boosting their performance on the course. Currently, 
          the use of EEG devices in sports is unprecedented, making Pursuit a pioneer in applying this advanced technology to elevate athletic

          <SlideReveal>
            <p>
              To measure their health, fitness, and overall performance metrics,
              athletes are mostly using:
            </p>
          </SlideReveal>
          <SlideReveal>
            <ul>
              <li>Apple Watch</li>

              <li>Oura Ring</li>
            </ul>
          </SlideReveal>
          <SlideReveal>
            <p>
              However, even though these devices track overall health and
              fitness metrics, they do not track focus, concentration, or
              relaxation levels when a athlete is performing on a golf course.

          </SlideReveal>

            <p>
              <strong>Performance analytics conclusion:</strong> The devices
              that athletes are using track overall health metrics such as heart
              rate, recovery and more; however, There is no device that tracks
              focus and relaxation during training sessions by leveraging EEG
              data. Possible integration with these tools may be possible to
              give a holistic view on all performance metric, but for a minimal
              viable product, the goal is to measure and track focus levels
              while performing.

            <p>
              The primary tracking tool used by golf professionals to monitor
              their performance is TrackMan, an industry-leading device. Despite
              the availability of automated tools to track golf performance,
              both pros and junior players often prefer to manually input their
              practice performance into an application. This preference
              highlights an interesting trend: higher-level players favour
              manual data entry over automated solutions.

              <strong>Golf Analytics Devices Conclusion:</strong> In the future,
              integrating TrackMan to measure the correlation between focus and
              golf performance could be highly beneficial. However, most elite
              athletes are currently comfortable with manually inputting their
              data.

            <p>
              Currently, athletes are journaling and measuring their mental
              performance based on how their feel. There is is no metric based
              apps to help them with this. Athletes identified that they would
              like to be able to measure their focus and relaxation levels
              throughout their golf training.

              Due to time constraints, we tested the designs with five coaches

              that only the designs were tested, not the development work
              required to integrate the devices with the application. This
              integration still needs to be completed before full functionality
              can be tested.

                However, they noted that they need to see this implemented with
                the device to assess the accuracy and relevance of these metrics
                in the field.
